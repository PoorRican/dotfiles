# Wiki Manager

Use this skill when wiki content must be created, reorganized, or rewritten.

## Responsibilities

1. Create new notes and daily logs using existing naming patterns.
2. Keep headings and link structure consistent with the vault.
3. Perform larger edits safely and verify resulting links.

## Guardrails

- Scope writes to the allowed wiki directory.
- Avoid destructive edits unless explicitly requested.
- After writing, re-read changed files to confirm content and format.
