# Nautilus Trader Skill

## Overview

NautilusTrader is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade algorithmic trading platform that enables quantitative traders to backtest and deploy automated trading strategies with an event-driven architecture. The platform's core components are written in Rust and Cython for maximum performance while maintaining a Python-native interface.

**Key Features:**
- Event-driven architecture with nanosecond resolution
- Identical code for backtesting and live trading (no reimplementation needed)
- Multi-venue, multi-asset support (crypto, FX, equities, futures, options)
- High-performance core with Rust/Cython binaries and Python bindings

## Important Notes for AI Assistants

When helping users with Nautilus Trader:

1. **Read selectively** - Only read the files relevant to the user's question
2. **Start with the main file** - This SKILL.md provides context
3. **Reference documentation** - Always check official docs for latest API
4. **Consider user context** - Backtest vs. live, beginner vs. advanced
5. **Emphasize testing** - Always recommend backtesting before live deployment
6. **Be aware of breaking changes** - API is still evolving
7. **Prioritize safety** - Risk management is critical in live trading

This skill should be used whenever users ask about algorithmic trading, event-driven backtesting, strategy development, or production trading systems in Python.
